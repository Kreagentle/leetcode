# Create Simple Singly Linked List DS

Write a code in the language of your choice to implement a singly linked list. A singly linked list has the following properties:
* Each node contains a piece of data. Node class constructor  takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.
* Each node also holds a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. A  next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.
* LinkedList class constructor takes a value as an argument and creates new node object based on Node class with that value.
head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.
* A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

# Insertion at the Beginning of a Singly Linked List

Write a function to insert a new element at the beginning of a singly linked list. LinkedList and Node class are already provided.

# Insertion at the End of a Singly Linked List

Write a method to insert a new element at the end of a singly linked list. The logic should cover edge cases such as empty linked list or linked list with some elements in it.

# Deletion from a Singly Linked List

Write a function to delete a node from a singly linked list. The function should take the index(starting from 0) of the node to be deleted as a parameter.

# Reverse a Singly Linked List

Write a function to reverse a singly linked list. The function should return a new linked list that is the reverse of the original list.

```sh
Original singly linked list:   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Reversed singly linked list:  5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

# Middle of a Singly Linked List

Write a function to find and return the middle node of a singly linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second of the two middle nodes.
