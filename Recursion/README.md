# Power

Write a function called power which accepts a base and an exponent. The function should return the power of the base to the exponent. This function should mimic the functionality of math.pow() - do not worry about negative bases and exponents.


```sh
power(2,0) # 1
power(2,2) # 4
power(2,4) # 16
```

# Factorial
Write a function factorial which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number. A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g., factorial four ( 4! ) is equal to 24, because 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 equals 24. factorial zero (0!) is always 1.

```sh
factorial(1) # 1
factorial(2) # 2
factorial(4) # 24
factorial(7) # 5040
```

# ProductofArray

Write a function called productOfArray which takes in an array of numbers and returns the product of them all.

```sh
productOfArray([1,2,3]) #6
productOfArray([1,2,3,10]) #60
```

# RecursiveRange

Write a function called recursiveRange which accepts a number and adds up all the numbers from 0 to the number passed to the function.

```sh
recursiveRange(6) # 21
recursiveRange(10) # 55 
```
