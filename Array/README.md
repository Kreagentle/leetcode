# Missing Number Finder

This Python script contains a function to find a missing number in a given integer array within the range of 1 to 100.

## Functionality

The script defines a function missing_number that calculates and returns the missing number from the given integer array and the total count of integers.

```sh
missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6)
```

# Max Product of Two Integers

Find the maximum product of two integers in an array where all elements are positive.

```sh
arr = [1, 7, 3, 4, 9, 5] 
max_product(arr) # Output: 63 (9*7)
```

# Middle Function

Write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the first and last elements.

```sh
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4]
middle(myList)  # [2,3]
```

# 2D Lists

Given 2D list calculate the sum of diagonal elements.

```sh
myList2D= [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] 
diagonal_sum(myList2D) # 15
```

# Best Score

Given a list, write a function to get first, second best scores from the list.
List may contain duplicates.

```sh
myList = [84,85,86,87,85,90,85,83,23,45,84,1,2,0]
first_second(myList) # 90 87
```

# Duplicate Number

Write a function to remove the duplicate numbers on given integer array/list.

```sh
remove_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

# Pairs

Write a function to find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number. Do not consider commutative pairs.

```sh
pair_sum([2, 4, 3, 5, 6, -2, 4, 7, 8, 9],7)
Output : ['2+5', '4+3', '3+4', '-2+9']
```

# Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

```sh
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

# Rotate Matrix/ Image - LeetCode 48

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

```sh
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

# Longest Substring Without repeating character

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 
```sh
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

# Spirical matrix

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

```sh
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

# Move zeros

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

```sh
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
